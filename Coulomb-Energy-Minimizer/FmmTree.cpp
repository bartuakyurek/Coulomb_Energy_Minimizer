/**
 * Explanation of initStruct()
 *
 * First For Loop:
 *
 * Incrementing on i (i is row number of the struct matrix as well as refinement level)
 *
 * Each element of struct (let's say row number i) is initialized as a vector (column corresponding to the row)
 * of Box objects with its size being the number of cells for the refinement level i (4^i)
 *
 * Inside the first for loop is a second loop incrementing on j
 * (j is the column number of the struct matrix as well as the cell index n)
 *
 * Thinking of struct as a matrix.  Each element of the (matrix) struct is also
 * a Box object - Box(i,j,potential.getP()) where
 * - i is the row number
 *   - with respect to the Box constructor this the refinement level
 * - j is the column number
 *   - with respect to the Box constructor this is the cell index
 * - p is an integer from the potential object
 *   - with respect to the Box constructor this is the truncation index for the series approximation
 *
 * Second and Third For Loop:
 *
 * The second loop increments over i through each the source particle x[i].
 *  - For the refinement level numOfLevels-1, getBoxIndex determines the cell index n for each source particle x[i]
 *  - The addX member function of Box is called to add the source point x[i] to that cell (or box)
 *
 * The third loop increments over i through each the target particle y[i].
 *  - For the refinement level numOfLevels-1, getBoxIndex determines the cell index n for each source particle y[i]
 *  - The addY member function of Box is called to add the target point y[i] to that cell (or box)

  //             where the source points x[i] are far enough away from thisBox
  //             that the potential calculation can be approximated by a series
  //       [7] - retrieving series coefficients D (could be done outside this loop)
  //       [8] - retrieving powers of R-expansion for thisY
  //       [9] - for each of p terms of R-expansion series
  //        [10] - calculating and adding the first p terms of the series - a
  //               truncated approximation to the infinite series
  //      [11] - initializing the singular part of the potential calculation

  //             the potential calculation with a series and the calculation
  //             must be done directly

/* Explanation of upwardPass
 *
 * The 1st part of the upward pass starts at the highest level of refinement (lowest level l = L)
 * l = numOfLevels-1.  The first step of the upward pass is to obtain the far-field
 * expansions (really just the coefficients of the expansions) for all the sources
 * w.r.t. the center of the cell in which they are located at this refinement level.
 * A for loop over the cells at this refinement level starts this member function.
 * While looping over a cell the potential functions corresponding to all source points
 * of the cell are approximated by far-field expansions whose center is the center of
 * the cell.  Corresponding coefficients of these approximations are added together
 * to form one series for all the sources of the cell (since the powers of each source's series
 * were the same).  Once this loop is complete we have far-field s-expansion for each cell
 * (all the sources of each cell) at the lowest level.
 *
 * The 2nd part of the upward pass is a nested loop.  The outer loop is over each refinement
 * level, working upward.   The inner loop is over the cells at that particular refinement level.
 * The purpose of the second part of the upward pass is to shift the center of the source expansion
 * for a cell at the current refinement level (child level) up to the center at the parent level.
 * Once this nested loop is complete, we have a far-field expansion for each box (cell) at any
 * level l >= 2 that incorporates all of the sources located within that cell (box).
 *
 * The purpose of the 2nd part of the upward pass is to minimize the work in obtaining approximations to
 * the potential function between a target and a source that are far from each other.  For example,
 * suppose that at level l = 2, a source and target are one cell away.  Then at this level, the source cell
 * is in the interaction list of the target cell and we would approximate the potential function with
 * a far field expansion.  Further, we can approximate all the sources of the source cell with an s-expansion
 * Therefore, to save operations we take the s-expansion for the cell (all source incorporated) instead of going
 * down to the lowest refinement level taking each source point expansion individually.  The purpose of the downward
 * pass is to determine when distances between cells are far enough to perform these operations.

/* Explanation of downwardPass1
 *
 * This is the First Part of the Downward Pass.  The member function is a
 * nested loop.  The outer loop is over the levels of refinement and works
 * from level l = 2 (coarse refinement level) to the bottom level (most refined).
 * Once the level is set the middle loop is over the cells of the refinement level.
 * On each pass through the middle loop, the interactive list of the cell being
 * addressed is obtained.
 *
 * Recall that the E4 index is the interactive list of a cell.
 * For a given cell, the E4 list is the set of all peer cells that are the children
 * of the given cell's parent's nearest neighbors excluding the nearest neighbors of the cell.
 *
 * With the interactive list of the cell of interest obtained, the inner loop of the member
 * function is then started over the cells of the interactive list.  During a pass in the inner loop
 * the far-field coefficients of the interactive list cell set by the inner loop are S|R transformed
 * from the interactive list cell center to the center of the cell of interest set by the outer loop.
 * The new coefficients of the series due to sources in the interactive list are saved (added to) to
 * the Dtilde vector of the cell of interest.

 *                                         l = 3
 *
 * This is the Second Part of the Downward Pass.  The main component of this
 * member function is a nested loop.  However the first step of the function is a loop
 * through refinement level l = 2 copying the Dtilde coefficients obtained in the First
 * Part of the Downward Pass to the D Coefficients.  Level l = 2 is special since the
 * interactive list makes up the rest of the domain when considered with a cell's
 * nearest neighbors (shown above).  The other levels do not have this property.
 *
 * However, as we move down another level and consider a particular cell at that level,
 * the rest of the domain that is outside the nearest neighbors of that cell can be expressed
 * as a union of the interactive lists of the parent and grandparent cells.  For example, consider
 * the cell c in the level l = 3 illustration above.  Outside of the nearest neighbors n of cell
 * c, the rest of the domain is the union of the interaction list of the cell with the interaction
 * list of the parent cell.
 *
 * More generally, since a child cell's interactive list are made up of children of the nearest neighbors
 * of the parent cell, and the parent cell's interactive list are peer cells beyond its nearest neighbors,
 * the interactive lists of a parent and child do not have any cells (or source points) in
 * common.  That is, the interactive lists of a parent and a child cell are mutually exlusive and
 * there is no overlap in accounting for source points in the union of a parent and child's
 * interactive lists.  Therefore, once the nearest neighbors of a cell are accounted for, the rest of
 * the domain is the union of the hierarchy of the parents' mutually exclusive interaction lists all the
 * way up to level l = 2.
 *
 * In the main part of the code, the outer loop is over the levels of refinement, working
 * from level l = 2 (coarse refinement level) to the bottom level (most refined level).
 * The middle loop is over the cells of the refinement level and collects the indexes of the
 * child cells of the cell fixed by the loop.  The inner loop loops over the collection
 * of child cells and performs an R|R translation of the series whose coefficients have been
 * collected in D.
 *
 * That is, in the 1st part of the DownwardPass, the far-field series of all
 * the sources in the interaction list of a cell were S|R translated to the center of the cell.
 * At el = 2 ( l = 2) in the outerloop of downwardPass2 these series are then translated
 * to the children cells of each cell at l = 2.  In other words, the sources that
 * are outside the nearest neighbors of a cell at l = 2 were translated to the child cells
 * and are contained in the vector D.  That means that a child cell at l = 3 had all sources taken
 * care of outside of its interaction list (outside of the parent's nearest neighbors).  We also know from the
 * First Part of the Downward Pass that the child cell contains in Dtilde the series for the sources
 * in its interaction list.  Therefore for each cell at l = 3, the only sources left to consider
 * are those in the cell's nearest neighbors.  This last step is taken care of in the last part of the
 * FmmTree member function FmmTree::solve().
 *
 * Once the R|R translation takes place of the series from the interaction list of a parent
 * to the child's center, the new coefficients are saved in the D vector of the child's cell.
 * The coefficients from the series of the sources in the interaction list of the child cell
 * are also added to the D vector.  Then all that is not accounted for are the sources in the
 * nearest neighbors of the child.
 *
 * We continue with the next pass through the outer loop el = 3 (refinement level = 3) to make
 * sure the code is clear.  At l = 3, the children are gathered and the series contained in D
 * of each cell at l = 3 is translated to the children.  That means the interaction lists
 * sources for the parent and the grandparent at l = 2 are translated to the child.  Therefore,
 * all sources are accounted for with the child except the interaction list and nearest neighbor
 * sources.  Before completing the loop, the interaction list is accounted for and all that is
 * left are the nearest neighbors sources, which are taken care of in the end of FmmTree::solve.
